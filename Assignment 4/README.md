# DH150 -- Assignment 04: Contextual Inquiry -- by Jiaqi Zhou (Xenia)
## Theme: Health

## Description of project
### Step01: Specify the main design challenge 

- What is the main activity your project would support the users?
  - xx
  - xx
- What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
- What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
- What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?




### Step02: Target users 

- What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
- Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
- What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)


### Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 

- Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation.
- Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO)


## Contextual inquiry guide (script)
### Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 

- Decide where to visit
- Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
- Decide how to interact with the users 
- Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
- Prepare the interview guide (examples + template here -- this guide is designed for search activity but you need to edit with your contextual questions according to the activity, not search activity, you want to learn from the users)

## User Data 
### Step05: Conduct the research

- Visit the place
- Meet/Observe the user(s)- Collect the data (record, pictures, answered_survey)


## Transcript


## Reflection
## Step06: Organize/Documentation

- In github (sub)repository assignment5, create one document (either README.md or .html)
- Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2)
- Describe your research methods and plan (step3)
- Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 
- Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github
- Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)
- Provide a link to the transcript of your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-alouds during observation, useful transcript tool here) 
- Write a reflection
