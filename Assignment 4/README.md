# DH150 -- Assignment 04: Contextual Inquiry -- by Jiaqi Zhou (Xenia)
## Theme: Health

## Description of project (design challenge, target users, research method(s))
### Step01: Specify the main design challenge 

Health issues are always important topics around the world. Even though the health care system has been improved, so as people's living quality, there are more and more people worried about their health condition. Our product is designed to provide users with more professional health-related information. It is convenient for people to search for health topics online, but some people would judge the credibility of information on the internet. The major challenge for a health site is to provide both professional feedbacks and easy-to-conduct solutions to users so that they would trust the website and rely on it every time they need help or advice. Information on the website should also contain names that are familiar to the users to avoid any confusion. In this activity, the user was asked to find any solutions that help relieve computer vision syndrome, and the user could use any methods that are comfortable to him. Since the interviewee was a Chinese, he preferred using a Chinese search engine called Baidu in his daily life to search for health topics. The current solutions are online suggestions such as looking at a far-away distance, doing some exercises, or staying away from computers for a while, etc. The user also showed another health issue that borders him a lot, hives. He was skeptical of the information if it was from commercial sites instead of from professional health sites. Most of the information online will only provide general causes and possible solutions, which may not satisfy the user's needs. If the user cannot determine the real causes of his health issues, he would not know which option is more effective. With digital technology, it is possible to hire professionals to answer users' concerns remotely, either via Zoom or any communication devices. In this way, our product can build credibility, and our users can get help easily.   



### Step02: Target users 

Nowadays, people are connected to the internet, and they will rely on the internet to make decisions. As the internet becomes more convenient, it provides a better opportunity for people to search for health information online. I sought users ages 18 to 40, who can access the internet easily, and they would be more likely to turn to the internet for the solution. While working or studying at a computer all day, this group of people is more or less suffering from some common health issues such as computer vision syndrome, overweight and obesity, and even mental health. Moreover, young people use social media a lot in their daily life, and they will be affected the way they deal with their health. Especially during these difficult times, people stay at home and work on their computers all day long, they would care more about their health. The users can do the activity anywhere as long as they have a laptop, an iPad, or just a mobile phone. It is handy for them to search for health-related subjects. When the users go online to look up health-related information, some would expect to seek advice on medical problems, some are interested in fitness or diet information, and some need more information about OTC drugs or supplements before they buy them.    


### Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 

- The interview was done through passive observation - the interviewee was being observed in the setting, but the interviewer did not participate in the activities except for asking questions. The interview was held via Zoom, while the user was at his home and used his preferred tools to complete the tasks.
- Observations included:
  - The interviewee's facial expression
  - The search engine and keywords used to search for information
  - How fast he can find what he wants
  - What information is included in the webpage


## Contextual inquiry guide (script)
### Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 

- Decide where to visit
  - Via Zoom 
- Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
  - To search for/find solution to health-related information
- Decide how to interact with the users 
  - Watch the interviewee conduct task, and ask questions if needed
- Decide how to collect user data 
  - Recording video on Zoom, and using Otter for transcript

## Reflection

It is convenient for people to find health-related information online whenever and wherever they want, but those health sites should also be humanized and professional to make users feel easier to engage with. After the Contextual Inquiry, I've learned that the outcome of the interview can be unexpected. When preparing for the interview, I would come up with some possible scenarios and put down tentative questions. Even if I prepared for the script with all the questions, the user's behaviors would make me change the questions I wanted to ask. When I observed how the interviewee was completing the tasks, I appreciated that he was very talkative and would like to share with me what he found and how he found the information. However, as an interviewer, one challenge for me was to encourage the user to show me more about how he found satisfying solutions to the task. I understand that both of us were nervous during the interview, but the experience has helped me grow. In the future interview, I will try to ask some relaxing questions before we get into the contextual inquiry section. I will also give more time for the users to plan out what they want to do without interrupting.
