## Theme: Health

## Description of project
### Step01: Specify the main design challenge 

The health issues are always been significant topics around the world. Even though the health care system has been improved, so as people's living quality, there are more and more people worried about thier health condition. Our product is designed to provide users with more professional health-related information. It is conveninent for people to search for health topics online, but some people would judge the credibility of information on the internet. The major chanllenge for a health site is to provide both professional feedbacks and easy-to-conduct solution to users, so that they would trust the site and rely on it every time they need help or advice. Information on the webiste should also contain names that are familiar to the users to avoid any confusion. In this activity, the user will be asked to find any solutions that help relieve computer vision syndrome, and the user can use any methods that are comfortable to him. The current solutions will be online suggestion such as looking at a far away distance, doing some exercises, or staying away from computers for a while, etc.  However, information online will only provide general causes and possible silutions, which may not satisfy the user's needs. If the user cannot determine the real causes to his health issues, he would not know which option is more effective. With digital technology, it is possible to hire professionals to answer users' concerns remotely, either via Zoom or any communication devices. In this way, our product can build credibility and our users can get help easily.   



### Step02: Target users 

Nowadays, people are connected to the internet, and they will rely on the internet to make decisions. As the internet becomes more convinence, it provides a better opportunity for people to search for health information online. I sought users ages 18 to 40, who work or study at a computer all day. Because these people more or less have some common health issues such as computer vision syndrome, overweight and obesity, and even mental health. These group of people can access the internet easily, and they would be more likely to turn to the internet for solution. Moreover, these group of people use social media a lot in their daily life, and people will be affected the way they deal with their health. Especially during these difficult times, people stay at home and work on their computers all day long, they would care more about their health. The users can do the activity anywhere as long as they have a computer, an iPad, or just a mobile phone. It is handy for them to search for health-related subjects. When the users go online to look up health-related information, some would expect to find advices on medical problems, some are interested in fitness or diet information, and some need more information about OTC drugs or supplements before they buy them.    


### Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 

The interview was done through passive observation. The interview was held via Zoom, while the user was at his home and used both online or offline tools to complete the tasks.
