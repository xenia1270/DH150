# DH150 -- Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype -- by Jiaqi Zhou (Xenia)

## Description of project 
My research is to evaluate the design of a healthcare site -- Healthline. Healthline is a healthcare website that provides health and wellness information. By collecting qualitative and quantitative data, we are able to get insights into how well the website supports users to accomplish their goals. The research will be based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to identify design issues on the Healthline website.The target users are people age from 18 to 50 with wider familiarity with the online environment. After the Userbility test, I was able to conduct both quantitative and qualitative studies to get insights into how people use health-related websites. These findings are useful for creating persona and prototypes to improve the site features.

The purpose of this high fidelity proptotype is to convert the low fidelity wireframes into a high fidelity demo. With a high fidelity prototype, we are able to present our product in details and have target users validate the concepts. During the usability testing, the users can interact with the components, layouts, and colors to help us improve the product.

Tasks:
- Convert low fidelity prototype to high fidelity prototype
- 
- 

## Graphic design


## Impression test
