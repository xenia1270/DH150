# DH150 -- Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype -- by Jiaqi Zhou (Xenia)

## Description of project 
My research is to evaluate the design of a healthcare site -- Healthline. Healthline is a healthcare website that provides health and wellness information. By collecting qualitative and quantitative data, we are able to get insights into how well the website supports users to accomplish their goals. The research will be based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to identify design issues on the Healthline website.The target users are people aged from 18 to 50 with wider familiarity with the online environment. After the Usability test, I was able to conduct both quantitative and qualitative studies to get insights into how people use health-related websites. These findings are useful for creating persona and prototypes to improve the site features.

Purpose: The purpose of this high fidelity prototype is to convert the low fidelity wireframes into a high fidelity demo. With a high fidelity prototype, we are able to present our product in details and have target users validate the concepts. During the usability testing, the users can interact with the components, layouts, and colors to help us improve the product. 

Process: I first converted the idea from the low fidelity wireframes by setting up the header, footer, menu, and contents in each page. Then I add buttons and icons to increase clarity and readability. I also applied the layout grid (12 column) to ensure consistency across the page. Next, I adjusted the color of the buttons and texts by using Contrast Checker. Lastly, I added the interaction to each button and made sure they were assigned to the correct page. 


Tasks:
- Convert low fidelity prototype to high fidelity prototype
- Create the header, footer, menu, and contents
- Check the color contrast for the accessibility WCAG2.0 AA level
- Test interactions of every buttons
- Ensure legibility and readability by choosing a font style
- Add appropriate icons to communicate a concept quickly

### Description of decision making
- Color: before I applied colors to the prototype, I ran the audits to check the color code on the original website. The audits showed the background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio. The foreground color is iris blue (#01ABD9) and the background color is white (#FFFFFF), which results in a 2.73:1 contrast ratio. To increase the brightness between two colors, I used WebAIM to adjust the lightness of the foreground color and checked which color will give a contrast ratio larger than 4.5:1 to target the WCAG (level2, AA) recommendation. I decided to use the bahama blue (#1F5A7F) for the foreground color with white background #FFFFFF. Some texts are in black font color (#000000), which has very high contrast with the white background. As for the original footer, the background color is light orange (#FBF5ED) and foreground colors include black (#000000), grey (#918F8F), and iris blue (#01ABD9). The color contrast between light orange and grey, light orange and iris blue are pretty low, so I decided to change the background color to seashell (FFF8F5), texts in grey are changed to black (#000000), and texts in iris blue (#01ABD9) are changed to bahama blue (#1F5A7F). 
  - Note: the names of colors are found from <a href="https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/">HTML CSS Color Picker</a>
- Images and icons: I tried to keep the original images choices like those on the articles, news, and doctor’s profile picture thumbnail. I changed the picture on the home page by including a picture of a doctor because the original home page contains too many images from different articles, which could not give users a good first impression. With an image of a doctor on the home page can convince users that lands on the website that the site is professional and trustworthy. I noticed that the healthline website does not have any icons, so I added some icons to some of the pages to engage users and communicate the ideas more effectively. 
- Typography: the original font (Proxima Nova) looks legit and readable, and I wanted to keep the original font. However, I could not find the same font in Figma. I decided to use Source Sans Pro, which is one of the most used fonts on medical websites.

- Button corner radius: the buttons on the original website have sharp corners, which is too rigid and less distinguishable. To make buttons more standout, I changed the corner radius to 10 to keep the site’s professionalism and reduce distraction.
