# DH150 -- Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype -- by Jiaqi Zhou (Xenia)

## Description of project 
My research is to evaluate the design of a healthcare site -- Healthline. Healthline is a healthcare website that provides health and wellness information. By collecting qualitative and quantitative data, we are able to get insights into how well the website supports users to accomplish their goals. The research will be based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to identify design issues on the Healthline website.The target users are people aged from 18 to 50 with wider familiarity with the online environment. After the Usability test, I was able to conduct both quantitative and qualitative studies to get insights into how people use health-related websites. These findings are useful for creating persona and prototypes to improve the site features.

Purpose: The purpose of this high fidelity prototype is to convert the low fidelity wireframes into a high fidelity demo. With a high fidelity prototype, we are able to present our product in details and have target users validate the concepts. During the usability testing, the users can interact with the components, layouts, and colors to help us improve the product. 

Process: I first converted the idea from the low fidelity wireframes by setting up the header, footer, menu, and contents in each page. Then I add buttons and icons to increase clarity and readability. I also applied the layout grid (12 column) to ensure consistency across the page. Next, I adjusted the color of the buttons and texts by using Contrast Checker. Lastly, I added the interaction to each button and made sure they were assigned to the correct page. 


Tasks:
- Convert low fidelity prototype to high fidelity prototype
- Create the header, footer, menu, and contents
- Check the color contrast for the accessibility WCAG2.0 AA level
- Test interactions of every buttons
- Ensure legibility and readability by choosing a font style
- Add appropriate icons to communicate a concept quickly
