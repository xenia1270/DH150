### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 

My research is to evaluate the UX design of a healthcare site -- Healthline. I chose my project on health-related topic because more and more people care about their health, and people tend to explore health information online. Healthline is a healthcare website that provides health and wellness information. By collecting qualitative and quantitative data, we can get insights into how well the website supports users in accomplishing their goals. The research will be based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to identify design issues on the Healthline website. The target users are people aged from 18 to 50 with wider familiarity with the online environment. After the Usability test, I was able to conduct both quantitative and qualitative studies to get insights into how people use health-related websites. These findings are useful for creating personas and prototypes to improve site features.

### Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
Summary and link to your assignment folder

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
Summary and link to your assignment folder

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype

### Optional evaluation and revision history 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)

### Pitch video 

### Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?
