# Healthline UX Analysis
## Xenia Zhou

### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 

My research is to evaluate the UX design of a healthcare site -- Healthline. Healthline is a healthcare website that provides health and wellness information. By collecting qualitative and quantitative data, we can get insights into how well the website supports users in accomplishing their goals. The research will be based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to identify design issues on the Healthline website. The target users are people aged from 18 to 50 with wider familiarity with the online environment. After the Usability test, I was able to conduct both quantitative and qualitative studies to get insights into how people use health-related websites. These findings are useful for creating personas and prototypes to improve site features.

### Clear design statement: 
I started the first two assignment with Philips commercial website but later switched to healthline because I believe it has more health information toward the benefit to the public. I chose my project on health-related topic because more and more people care about their health, and people tend to explore health information online. UX design is important in fulfilling users' needs when users are using computers or phones to access information. 

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
I choose to focus on the home appliance business that provides innovative products to serve consumers in their everyday life. I feel obsessed with everyday gadgets because they offer assistance in our daily life and help us live a better lifestyle. I believe that not only the design of products that leads to the companyâ€™s success but also the accessibility of its website. In this assignment, I choose two home appliance companies that have different brand awareness. The first website is the website for Philips, which has a high level of brand awareness and has the most influential product design. The second website is the website for a local home appliance store called Home & Farm Kitchen Supply, which is welcome by local people for its unique cooking utensils. I hope to contribute to the UX design of these two websites and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. [...read more >](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/README.md)

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on usa.philips.com, several usability concerns needed to be addressed. First, some product icons are not consistent and would create confusion as users browsing the website. Second, the search field does a poor job outputting the results. For example, when a user types in the keyword in the search box, the results are a list of articles instead of the product itself. Third, the website lacks user control and freedom as it does not provide the undo and redo functions. Fourth, some product pages contain irrelevant information that conflicts with the aesthetic and minimalist design principle. Finally, the layout designs and colors are not consistent in each product page, which causes distraction when the user is browsing through different products.

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
The major challenge for a health site is to provide both professional feedbacks and easy-to-conduct solutions to users so that they would trust the website and rely on it every time they need help or advice. Information on the website should also contain names that are familiar to the users to avoid any confusion. In this activity, the user was asked to find any solutions that help relieve computer vision syndrome, and the user could use any methods that are comfortable to him. Since the interviewee was a Chinese, he preferred using a Chinese search engine called Baidu in his daily life to search for health topics. The current solutions are online suggestions such as looking at a far-away distance, doing some exercises, or staying away from computers for a while, etc. The user also showed another health issue that borders him a lot, hives. He was skeptical of the information if it was from commercial sites instead of from professional health sites. Most of the information online will only provide general causes and possible solutions, which may not satisfy the user's needs. If the user cannot determine the real causes of his health issues, he would not know which option is more effective. With digital technology, it is possible to hire professionals to answer users' concerns remotely, either via Zoom or any communication devices. In this way, our product can build credibility, and our users can get help easily. [...read more >](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/tree/master/Assignment%204)

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
The purpose of UX storytelling is to see things from the user's point of view and develop a product that satisfies the user's needs. Storytelling can allow UX designers to envision how the targeted user behaviors, think and feel when they are using the product. With the emotional connection, UX designers are able to visualize the goal that the user is trying to achieve and the problem that the user is facing. In this way, the UX designer can improve the product to make it more user-friendly and better serve the user. [...read more](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/tree/master/Assignment%205)

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to use limited time and resources to get insights into users' needs and receive feedback to detect and fix major interface issues. By using the Balsamiq tool to wireframe the interface, we can identify the pathways users take to complete the tasks and whether they understand the content. Since there are many medical terms on the healthcare website, it is important to accommodate people with different health literacy and different familiarity. With low-fidelity prototyping, we can invest more time and resources to optimize the user experience in the later stage.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
The process of creating a high fidelity portfolio was smooth as a whole since I already had a pretty solid structure from low fidelity portfolio. Even though it took me a while to get familiar with Figma, it works well to visualize the information and interactive components. There were some setbacks when making decisions on colors and buttons. For example, when I decided on changing the text and background color, I had to consider whether they have sufficient color contrast, and I will try to keep the color as close to the color on the original site as possible but with higher contrast. Also, since the original site only has a hamburger menu and contains too many items in one navigation, I needed to redesign a horizontal site menu to help users find content easier. After I received feedback from my peers, I made changes on some of the buttons and added a drop-down menu to make it look more intuitive.

### Optional evaluation and revision history 

#### Cognitive walkthrough
Some of the feature on the tools' pages are confusing. For example, they did not know why the Tools page would take them to the Symptom Checkers, which was the first page of the Tools. They found that the side menu with checkboxs was unclear as they did not know whether these were one of the selections/choices or buttons to use other tools. Some buttons contained too many words, so I should cut down to make it look clearer. The text size of title should be adjusted to make the it more distinguishable.[...read more >](https://ccle.ucla.edu/pluginfile.php/3492023/assignfeedback_file/feedback_files/2869001/DH150-Remote-Review-Xenia.pdf?forcedownload=1)

### Impressive test
The user's first impression was an image of two men (but actually there's only one man) and the color blue
The user believed the color blue matched the theme of the healthcare website, and the image reflected a sense of professionalism. Even though the user felt the size of the image looked good to him, he could not recall the "wellness tool" section below the image during the 5-second impression test. Therefore, I'm considering whether I should adjust the size of the content in the landing page. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx2xwZsz4VM">Link to impression test</a>

### Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?
When going through the UX design process, I've learned that it might be easy to create a website, but making a website that can fulfill users' needs is another story. Therefore, as a UX designer, we need to generate different users' needs and design a prototype that is user-friendly and accessible. It is not just simply presenting the content to the users, but how approachable is the content.
