# DH150 -- Asssignment 2: Pilot Usability Test -- by Jiaqi Zhou (Xenia)

## Introduction

<a href="https://www.usa.philips.com/">usa.philips.com</a> is Philips’s website that offers innovative health technology products and services to customers in the U.S.A. The website intends to provide users with a highly immersive shopping experience by providing various pictures and videos along with the products. The website categorizes the products into nine sections based on their features and noticeable icons, so users can easily find the desired products. 

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on usa.philips.com, several usability concerns needed to be addressed. First, some product icons are not consistent and would create confusion as users browsing the website. Second, the search field does a poor job outputting the results. For example, when a user types in the keyword in the search box, the results are a list of articles instead of the product itself. Third, the website lacks user control and freedom as it does not provide the undo and redo functions. Fourth, some product pages contain irrelevant information that conflicts with the aesthetic and minimalist design principle. Finally, the layout designs and colors are not consistent in each product page, which causes distraction when the user is browsing through different products. 

Therefore, I conducted the usability test to understand whether the Philips website’s design smooths or hinders the test process when the user is completing the tasks. The pilot test aims to measure the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the Philips website. The test also tries to identify any shortcomings that the website should be improved on and increase conversions. Task 1 will test the aesthetics and efficiency of the use of the toothbrush heads product page. This task aims to check whether useful information will be captured by the user quickly, and how much irrelevant information is presented as the user is browsing the product. Task 2 will test the consistency and minimality of the pasta makers’ product page. This task will check whether having lots of products related pictures, both static and dynamic, will make the user engaged or tired. Task 3 will test the effectiveness of the search box. Some users may prefer to find a product by typing in the keyword in the search box at the top instead of going through the catalog. The goal is to see how the user interacts with the website and find his desired product in a minimal amount of time. 

The onsite usability test was conducted using the website usa.philips.com on my laptop. I used Active Presenter software to capture the participant’s face, comments, and navigation choices. The user was asked to fill out the UT questionnaire on Google Forms while he was reviewing the website. 


## Methodology

Before I conducted UT, I made sure I prepared the following materials:
- Internet accessibility
- Laptop with camera  + test camera view area 
- Laptop should be 100% charged
- One table and two chairs -- should be comfortable for users
- Open browser usa.philips.com + survey link https://forms.gle/SWUXo4gyT5XZwPGz6 
- Check the voice recording volume
- Make sure mobile phone is on airplane mode
- Notebook + pen


The pilot test was conducted on April 11, 2020, at 606 Levering Ave, Los Angeles. The moderator and participant sat next to each other but gave the participant enough space to create a natural posture for conversation. During the session, I, the moderator,  first explained the purpose and process of the test. After the participant read the form and signed the consent, we moved on to a brief background and pre-test questionnaire. Then, the participant was asked to complete the task scenarios and find the information on the website. The moderator observed how the participant went through the tasks and took notes of my observations of the participants’ behavior, and any usability problems occurred. After completing three tasks, the participant was asked to fill out the post-test questionnaire and to rate the interface on a 7-point Likert Scale. The participant then selected the five cards that most closely matched his personal reactions to the Philips website. Finally, the participant filled out the demographic information that will be confidential and anonymous.
