# DH150 -- Assignment 06: Low Fidelity Prototype -- by Jiaqi Zhou (Xenia)
## Description of project 
### :white_check_mark: Brief summary of user-research, persona and three features in usage scenario
This user-research is to evaluate the design of a healthcare site -- Healthline. Healthline is a healthcare website that provides health and wellness information. By collecting qualitative and quantitative data, we are able to get insights into how well the website supports users to accomplish their goals. The research will be based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to identify design issues on the Healthline website.

I use three personas, Cindy, Paul, and Doria, whose ages are in the range of 18 to 50 because this group of people is active internet users, and they are more likely to use the Web for health information. They are designed as three different types of people with varying backgrounds of family, education, and occupations to examine how these people approach health information differently. The common feature is they care about their health and tend to use the Internet for health-related purposes. With three personas, I come up with three features to improve the website: Professional guides, Simplicity, and Accessibility.  


### :white_check_mark: The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to use limited time and resources to get insights into users' needs and receive feedback to detect and fix major interface issues. By using the Balsamiq tool to wireframe the interface, we can identify the pathways users take to complete the tasks and whether they understand the content. Since there are many medical terms on the healthcare website, it is important to accommodate people with different health literacy and different familiarity. With low-fidelity prototyping, we can invest more time and resources to optimize the user experience in the later stage.

In this low-fidelity prototyping, I want to emphasize three features under the scenarios:

:one: Professional guides
  - Online appointment with a doctor
  - 24/7 online chatbox for users who need psychological assistance
  - Goal Tracker tool with professional guidance
  
:two: Simplicity
  - Simplify the medical terms and each function on the website to users' needs
  - Include appropriate icons to increase fluency and improve task performance
  - Make the health articles or news more readable and understandable
  
:three: Accessibility
  - Easy to use keyboard navigation (may be improved in the later high fidelity prototype)
  - High font contrast and color contrast (may be improved in the later high fidelity prototype)
  - Easy to navigate the site and buttons are recognizable
  - Language selection


###  :white_check_mark: The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
- Allow the users to check the causes of symptoms
- Allow users to choose a language
- Filter information to receive more accurate results
- Online doctor's appointment to receive professional advice
- Register a new user account to further activities 
- Personal goal tracker
- Forums that allow users to engage with other usersâ€™ personal experiences and opinions
- Chatbox available for users who need psychological help

## Testing the wireflow

Notes:
- First screen: The section of "Things to be highlighted" may confuse the user
- First screen: The user was not sure whether the symptom checker tool is clickable (it should be clearer in the Balsamiq mockups)
- Second screen: It would be better to add a section that allows the user to enter detailed descriptions of symptoms
- Fifth screen: Should allow the user to leave a message to the doctor before the meeting
- Sixth screen: The user was kind of confused when to use the link
- Seventh screen: The user was curious whether the meeting will be recorded

Notes:
- First screen: The search bar was not obvious
- Fourth screen: The section should allow the user to search for related questions because f there are many questions people would not want to read all of them 
- Eleventh screen: The user was confused about the side menu of the goal Tracker

Notes:
- Menu: Include Articles with News
- Second screen: Highlight each topic to notify users that the texts can be clicked on
- Third screen: the Chatbox was too small, and the page should provide more contact methods for communication (it may not be accessible for some people with disabilities)
- Seventh screen: Notification of whether to record the meeting
- Eighth screen: The user was not clear what the MAP suggested here 

## Reflection 
I really enjoyed the process of creating the low-fidelity prototype because it gave me a sense of achievement to improve the website. Before I started drawing, I reviewed each persona's needs and guessed which tools on the website can better help them to achieve their goals. Overall, the testing with a low-fidelity prototype went smoothly. Before the user worked on each wireframe, I explained the three personas and what they want to achieve using the Healthline website. The user was able to follow the Wireflow to go through each screen. However, some places might be confusing for the user because he wasn't sure whether the buttons were clickable. Also, he noted that pages such as the appointment confirmation contain so much information that he was not confused about which button he should click on. Moreover, the user noticed that all of my three wireframes had the same online doctor feature, so he suggested providing another pathway to meet the person's need instead of using the online doctor for every case. For further high fidelity prototype, I would make sure each button is distinctive for users, and each page contains less but useful information to avoid any confusion. I also realized that it might be time-consuming for the user to read the contents and menu items. Therefore, I will consider adding more icons along with the menu items.

Notes:
- Some details or functions may be presented differently in the pencil sketches and Balsamiq Mockups, but the pathways are the same
- The tests were only able to be conducted on the pencil sketches due to the size and low resolution of Balsamiq Mockups images.
