## Short introduction about the purpose of ux storytelling
The purpose of UX storytelling is to see things from the user's point of view and develop a product that satisfy the user's needs. Storytelling can allow UX designers to envision how the targeted user behaviors, think, and feel when they are using the product. With the emotional connection, UX designers are able to visualize the goal that the user is trying to achieve and problem that the user is facing. In this way, UX designer can improve the product to make it more user-friendly and better serve the user.

## Scenarios + Journey map per each feature
### :woman_technologist: Cindy Scenarios
My first Persona is Cindy, an accountant in San Francisco, whose goals are to keep her son healthy, and try to balance work and family. 

During weekdays, Cindy has to go to work at 9:00 AM after she sends her son to her mother’s home. Cindy will pick up her son after work at around 6:00 PM. It’s 7:30 AM, Cindy wakes her son up peacefully as usual. She realizes that there are patches of red and itchy skin on her son’s cheeks and some on the neck. She thinks making an appointment may need to wait for several days, but the closest clinic for walk-in service is about an hour drive. She doesn’t have time to take her son to wait at the clinic for a walk-in. During her breakfast, she visits the healthline site and tries to use the Symptom Checker to find any solutions. The Symptom Checker also allows Cindy to filter keywords to get more accurate results. It’s possible that her son has normal eczema, and the site provides several options to help with symptoms. On the same page, Cindy is allowed to visit a physician online on the same day from 8AM to 8PM, and she can choose a preferred physician that speaks her language. Luckily, Cindy is able to choose the 8AM meeting with a Chinese-speaking physician; otherwise, she will need to wait until the next available appointment at 6:30PM. Cindy soon finishes breakfast and turns on Zoom meeting on her laptop. The consulting lasts 30 minutes, and the physician lists out foods to eat and avoid when having eczema. In minutes, the physician sends out the prescriptions to Cindy’s preferred pharmacy. Cindy can pick up the medication after she receives notification from the pharmacy through message. At about 9:00 PM, Cindy sends her son to her mother’s home, and she gives her mother the lists of food recommended by the physician (written in Chinese). She asks her mother to pick up the medication in the nearby Walgreens Pharmacy if she is available. Otherwise, she’ll need to pick up after work. With the help of virtual meeting with a physician, Cindy is able to keep her son healthy, and go to work without worrying too much about her family.

### :man: Paul Scenarios
My second persona is Paul, a Uber driver in Jackson, MS, whose goal is to maintain a healthy weight and improve the health quality.

Every morning at 6:30, Paul gets up to start his work day because early morning is one of the peak times for Uber drivers. He does not have time to make breakfast, so he drives to the nearby McDonald's to buy a Sausage Burrito. During lunch time, he often visits Panda Express before he takes a nap in his car. After he finishes driving at about 6:00 PM and has dinner with his family. After dinner, he usually lies on the couch to play with his phone. This is Paul’s daily routine. However, he feels like his situation is getting worse as he has increased sweating even after dinner in the winter, and has trouble breathing at night. He begins to pay more attention to the health news and visits some health sites when he has time. Sometimes he would take a walk in the backyard after dinner and does some simple exercises. However, he couldn’t stay motivated because he does not see any changes in his body. One day, when he’s browsing the healthline website, he happens to see a forum created for people with obesity to share experience, and there are specialists answering questions. Users can also make appointments with specialists to do a weekly 10 minutes check-in, so the specialists can set up healthy meal plans and workouts for individuals. Users are able to set up an account on the website to enter their daily workout time and weight, so that the users can the specialists can keep track of the progress to make adjustments on the plan. After a month of using the health site, Paul successfully loses 10 pounds.

### :woman_student: Doria Scenarios
My third persona is Doria, a a third-year college student majoring in computer science, whose goal is to balance college, work, and personal life.

Doria is a hard-working third-year CS major student. Despite her hectic class schedule, she also works part-time on campus as a front desk. After finishing the work, she nearly has time to join parties with friends. She usually stays up very late to get her homework and projects done. While she stresses over busy schedules, she is so frustrated to find out she has irregular menstrual cycles. Worse still, she may suffer from depression when facing the pressure from school and the process of applying for internships. Her depression and terrible health condition make her feel isolated. When she is feeling emotionally distressed, she often goes on social networking sites to share her thoughts instead of talking to her friends and families. She also tends to read some articles from health sites to see if she can get more information to improve her health. She tries to enter “depression” to the search box to see if she can find any helpful information. However, she does not want to read long and tedious medical reports. She also has concerns with information reliability from those sites. She happens to read an article from healthline site about college life and depression. There is a subsection talking about how depression affects women’s menstrual cycle, which triggers Doria’s interest. The article does not use many complex medical terms, and it allows users to leave comments or shares their thoughts, views, and emotions anonymously. Doria feels delighted as she finds out many college students also have the same experience. The site also offers a chatbox for users to talk to a professional psychologist. The chatbox is 24/7 available whenever users need some professional guidance. If needed, the psychologist may suggest having a video meet-up with Doria to provide better treatment. Though Doria is skeptical about the reliability of the chatbox, she gives it a try. She also receives  psychological treatment through the video consultation. She feels like she is being taken care of and she can talk to someone she can trust. Beside taking antidepressant medication and hormone medication, the psychologist also suggests well-balanced meals throughout the day. To keep monitoring Doria’s health, she is encouraged to share her progress on the site with the psychologists or any specialists she prefers.
