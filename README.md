# Home appliance business that cares people’s everyday life
## DH150 -- Asssignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation of Two Websites -- by Jiaqi Zhou (Xenia)

I choose to focus on the home appliance business that provides innovative products to serve consumers in their everyday life. I feel obsessed with everyday gadgets because they offer assistance in our daily life and help us live a better lifestyle. I believe that not only the design of products that leads to the company’s success but also the accessibility of its website. In this assignment, I choose two home appliance companies that have different brand awareness. The first website is the website for Philips, which has a high level of brand awareness and has the most influential product design. The second website is the website for a local home appliance store called Home & Farm Kitchen Supply, which is welcome by local people for its unique cooking utensils. I hope to contribute to the UX design of these two websites and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. 


### Website 1: Philips - https://www.usa.philips.com/

### Description about your motivation/relevance + initial overall evaluation about web/app before heuristic evaluation: 
I choose to evaluate the Philips company website because I recently started using its Sonicare product, and I am fascinated by the smart features and sleek design. I am interested in learning more about Philips products and how its product design became so successful. I know that Philips is one of the largest electronics companies in the world, and it has received awards for its industrial design. However, Philips' focus on product design does not mean they also have excellent website design. Overall, the website provides users with a feeling that they are shopping at a brick-and-mortar store by offering various pictures and videos to provide users with an immersive shopping experience. Philips has its products well listed under corresponding categories. However, different product pages have different background colors, which may make users feel overwhelmed and need to adapt to the change. Additionally, there is a problem with information overload, which may result in a high consumer turnover rate.

### Brief information about the website: 
The website lists out all kinds of products and services provided by Philips. The header consists of six sections: Products, Support, Professionals, a search field, My Philips, and Shopping cart. For example, the Product section lists out nine product categories with corresponding icons. The Support section offers different kinds of customer services to assist customers in planning, maintenance, and troubleshooting of a product. 

### Heuristic Evaluation:
#### 1 - Visibility of system status -- the system should provide feedbacks of users’ action and show progress status
Philips ensures that users receive feedback on their actions. When users add a product to the cart, the button color and text will change. There will be a pop-up window informing the current status of the shopping cart whenever users add a product to the cart. However, the pop-up window only sticks around for less than 5 seconds before users finish reviewing.  

Severity Rating: 1/3

![Feedback 2](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture3.png)

#### 2 - Match between system and the real world -- the system should use words or icons that are familiar to users
The product categories have recognizable icons, so users can quickly find the desired products. However, users may find the accessories section confusing as the icon shows three products that require some inferences. 

Some popular items replicate the familiarity of offline actions by providing pictures with different angles. However, some less popular items only have pictures displaying one angle, which lacks proximities to enhance users’ online shopping experience.   

Severity Rating: 2/3

![Icon 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture4.png)

#### 3 - User control and freedom -- the system should provide redo and undo functions if users choose system functions by mistake
If users find that they are viewing the wrong product, they can switch the pages from one product to another by simply clicking the “Products” button and choosing from the categories. However, if users are accidentally in the “Men’s Grooming Tools” page, the “Products” button is not working, and users cannot go back to the categories section unless they go back to the homepage and start from the beginning. 
Additionally, the header changes when users are in the Support - Part & Accessories - Philips Oral Healthcare page, and there is no button directing users to go back to the previous page. 
The header and the icon of the shopping cart are also not scroll fixed, which creates inconvenience for users to review their shopping cart at any point in time. Another problem is that if users don’t subscribe to their newsletter, the notification will be shown on every page and cannot be turned off.

Severity Rating: 3/3

![Freedom 2](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture31.png)

#### 4 - Consistency and standards -- the system should follow consistent conventions, so users would get the results they expect under the same operation across sites
Different product pages have different layout designs and colors, which makes users overwhelmed, and users need time to adapt to the change. 
The header of the website should consist of the same sections, no matter which page users are viewing the product. However, some product pages have different headers from other pages, which causes confusion and disorientation. 
Also, some icons are not consistent when referring to the same products/services. For example, the Household products and Personal care sections also confuse users as they use different icons across the page.

Severity Rating: 3/3

![Consistency 2](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture17.png)

![Consistency 6](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture8.png)

#### 5 - Error prevention -- prevent an error before it occurs, and a provide users with a confirmation option
When creating an account, the system provides hints on what characters the new password should contain to complete the signup process. However, it would be safer if the system allows users to reenter the password to confirm the one they created. Additionally, in the checkout address section, it would be better if the City, Zip Code, and State sections are prepopulated in case users make any typos.  
Severity Rating: 1/3

![Password 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture10.png)

#### 6 - Recognition rather than recall -- minimize users memory by giving more hints
The shopping cart shows product names, thumbnail images, prices, and quantities, and availability, which is sufficient if users don’t need further detailed information about each product. It would be nice if the shopping cart page contains an option to move items to a wishlist, provide a gift option, and allows a quick look at the product for more details without leaving the page. 

Severity Rating: 1/3

![Cart 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture18.png)

#### 7 - Flexibility and efficiency of use -- offer shortcuts or advanced options to improve efficiency
The seventh heuristics guideline of Nielsen’s Heuristics suggests a system to offer shortcuts for quick action. Though there is no shortcut presented for users, the site does a good job presenting a Recently viewed products section so users can easily get back to the products they were looking at.  

Severity Rating: 1/3

![Products 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture11.png)

#### 8 - Aesthetic and minimalist design -- only present useful and relevant information
It is understandable Philips wants to provide information on product design and professional advice on product usage. However, this may lead to information overload. There is too much information on one page with both static and dynamic pictures, which lacks white space to allow content to be more digestible.

Severity Rating: 2/3

![Design 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture19.png)

#### 9 - Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors -- when error occurs, the system should provide suggestions on how to fix it
When users enter invalid information, the system shows suggestions on how to rectify the problem. To offer users with more concise instructions, the system could provide images with confirming users where to find the product number/name. It could also take a step further by listing out possible product information.

Severity Rating: 1/3

![Errors 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture15.png)

#### 10 - Help and documentation -- allow users to search for help easily
It is easy to search for help by using the Contact us shortcut on the bottom right corner or click on the Support button on the top left of each page. The users can either browse topics by category or enter the model number for FAQs and user manuals. Though the system provides a chatbox, the chat is offline and not responsive.    

Severity Rating: 1/3

### Website 2:Home & Farm Kitchen Supply -- https://www.biggestlittlekitchenstore.com/

![Kitchen](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Kitchen%20Store%20Homepage.png)

### Description about your motivation/relevance + initial overall evaluation about web/app before heuristic evaluation: 
I am interested in cooking and would like to know whether local kitchenware stores like Home & Farm Kitchen Supply would have a user-friendly website, especially during COVID-19, when people are staying and cooking at home. Overall, the website does not look professional at first glance because it violates some web design conventions, such as the inconsistent font, position of the main navigation, and shopping cart icon, etc. A good thing about the site is that it leaves a lot of white space that gives more attention to call-to-actions and helps users read information without distractions. The website also streamlines the checkout process by offering simple checkout with minimal steps.

### Brief information about the website: 
Home & Farm Kitchen Supply is a local kitchenware store that sells culinary supplies in Northern California, and they have gadgets that people won’t find anywhere else. The header of the website consists of store information, including store name, contact information, and accepted payment methods. The top left of the site lists four sections: Popular Items & Gifts, Bridal Registry, Gift Certificates, and Cart / Checkout. Below these four sections is the product catalog, which is listed alphabetically for users to find items quickly if they know the name of the thing they want.  


### Heuristic Evaluation:

#### 1 - Visibility of system status -- the system should provide feedbacks of users’ action and show progress status
As users add a product to the cart, the system will direct users to the full cart overview page instead of showing a flexible pop-up window, even though there is a Continue Shopping button that takes users back to the previous page. Conventionally, the Cart/ Checkout button is usually displayed on the upper right of the webpage. Still, this site breaks the rule by putting the button on the left side along with the catalog, which may frustrate users. Even worse, the cart icon does not indicate the number of items in the cart, nor does it display any information when hovering over it.

Severity Rating:3/3

![Visibility 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture20.png)
![Visibility 2](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture23.png)
![Visibility 3](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture24.png)

#### 2 - Match between system and the real world -- the system should use words or icons that are familiar to users
Regardless of the header placement, the site uses recognizable icons along with straightforward content across all sections. It is also helpful to offer gift wrapping to make the experience more enjoyable. However, there is only one product image on each product page, which fails to provide multiple angles of the product to replicate the real-world behavior. 

Severity Rating:2/3

#### 3 - User control and freedom -- the system should provide redo and undo functions if users choose system functions by mistake
The site does not have a sign in section, which may attract some people who don’t want to create another account and are still able to browse all available items. But, it also means people don’t have an option to keep track of their order history or add the items to their wishlist to purchase later. It would be helpful if the site can offer both guest checkout and registration options. 

Severity Rating:2/3

#### 4 - Consistency and standards -- the system should follow consistent conventions, so users would get the results they expect under the same operation across sites
The font types and sizes are different across pages, especially the business name and tagline on the header. The font size of the website tagline is much larger than the business name, which makes the tagline catchy, and users may overlook the business name. The inconsistent font style reduces readability. Moreover, there are some inconsistencies between icons. For example, two shopping cart icons are referring to the same action; the icon symbolizing the Popular items section looks similar to the Free Gift Wrapping section.

Severity Rating:3/3

![Consistency 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture21.png)
![Consistency 2](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture22.png)

#### 5 - Error prevention -- prevent an error before it occurs, and a provide users with a confirmation option
Though the site does not indicate which field is required to fill out, it guides users with suggestions to prevent incorrect actions before moving onto the review section. 

Severity Rating:1/3

![Error 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture27.png)
![Error 2](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture28.png)

#### 6 - Recognition rather than recall -- minimize users memory by giving more hints
The checkout page shows item names and prices without providing item images, which increases cognitive load and reduces user satisfaction. Additionally, the site fails to provide a list of recently viewed products to increase user engagement. But, it is good to see a product page displaying related items for user convenience. 

Severity Rating:3/3

#### 7 - Flexibility and efficiency of use -- offer shortcuts or advanced options to improve efficiency
The site displays three of today’s popular items on the homepage to accelerate the purchasing process. However, the site disables users to manipulate and personalize frequent actions.  

Severity Rating:2/3

![Flexibility 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture30.png)

#### 8 - Aesthetic and minimalist design -- only present useful and relevant information
The site works well with white space, so users would feel comfortable reading the information. The site is simple, and only relevant information is shown on each product page. 

Severity Rating:1/3

![Aesthetic 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture26.png)

#### 9 - Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors -- when error occurs, the system should provide suggestions on how to fix it
There are no precise instructions on how to fix an incorrect search result. Error messages are not expressed in human-readable error messages.

Severity Rating:3/3

![Help 1](https://github.com/xenia1270/DH150/blob/master/Picture25.png)

#### 10 - Help and documentation -- allow users to search for help easily
It is simple to shop on Home & Farm Kitchen Supply, and information is easy to search if customers enter valid keywords. Though the site provides contact information, including store address, phone number, and email address, if customers need further information, it is not convenient without FAQs and helps sections.  

Severity Rating:2/3
