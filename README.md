# DH150 -- Asssignment 1

## Website 1: Philips - https://www.usa.philips.com/

## Description about your motivation/relevance + initial overall evaluation about web/app before heuristic evaluation: 
I choose to evaluate Philips company website because I recently started using its Sonicare electric toothbrush. I am interested in learning more about Philips products and how its product design became so successful. I know that Philips is one of the largest electronics companies in the world, and it has received awards for its industrial design. However, Philips' focus on product design does not mean they also have good website design. Before I started the heuristic evaluation, my overall feeling is that Philips has its products well listed under corresponding categories. However, different product pages have different background colors, which may make users feel overwhelmed and need to adapt to the change. 

## Brief information about the website: 
The website lists out all the products and services provided by Philips. It enables customers to browse a broader range of products, including size, color. For particular products, the site offers product presentations to provide users with an immersive shopping experience.

## Heuristic Evaluation:
### 1 - Visibility of system status -- the system should provide feedbacks of users’ action and show progress status
Philips ensures that users receive feedback on their actions. When users add a product to cart, the button color and text will change. There will be a pop-up window informing the current status of the shopping cart whenever users add a product to cart. However, the pop-up window only sticks around for less than 5 seconds before users finish reviewing.

### 2 - Match between system and the real world -- the system should use words or icons that are familiar to users
The products categories have recognizable icons, so users can quickly find the desired products. However, users may find the Accessories section confusing as the icon shows three products requires some inferences. The Household products and Personal care sections also confuse users as they use different icons acorss the page. Moreover, the online experience does not replicate the familiarity of offline actions. When customers shop in a store, they would pick up a product and look at it from a different angle. However, most of the product photos on Philips website only display one angle, which lacks proximities to enhance users online shopping experience.

### 3 - User control and freedom -- the system should provide redo and undo functions if users choose system functions by mistake
If users find that they are viewing a wrong product, they can switch the pages from one product to another by simply clicking the “Products” button and choosing from the categories. However, if users are accidently in the “Men's Grooming Tools” page, the “Products” button is not working and users cannot go back to the categories section, unless they go back to the homepage and start from the beginning. Additionally, even though there are some products displayed on the homepage, the icon of  the shopping cart is not shown, which creates disadvantages for users who want to review their shopping cart when they are on the homepage. Another problem is that if users don’t subscribe to their newsletter, the notification will be shown on every page and cannot be turned off.
Severity Rating: 3/3

### 4 - Consistency and standards -- the system should follow consistent conventions, so users would get the results they expect under the same operation across sites
Different product pages have different layout design and colors, which makes users overwhelmed, and users need time to adapt to the change. Also, some icons are not consistent when referring to the same products/services.
Severity Rating: 3/3

### 5 - Error prevention -- prevent an error before it occurs, and a provide users with a confirmation option
When creating an account, the system provides hints on what characters the new password should contain in order to complete the signup process. However, it would be safer if the system allows users to reenter the password to confirm the one they created. Additionally, in the checkout address section, it would be better if the City, Zip Code, and State sections are prepopulated in case users make any typos. 
Severity Rating: 1/3

### 6 - Recognition rather than recall -- minimize users memory by giving more hints
Shopping cart shows product names, thumbnail images, prices, and quantities, and availability, which is sufficient if users don’t need further detailed information about each product. It would be nice if the shopping cart page contains an option to move items to wishlist, provide a gift option, and allows quick look at the product for more details without leaving the page.
Severity Rating: 1/3

### 7 - Flexibility and efficiency of use -- offer shortcuts or advanced options to improve efficiency
The seventh heuristics guideline of Nielsen’s Heuristics suggests a system to offer shortcuts for quick action. Though there is no shortcut presented for users, the site does a good job presenting a Recently viewed products section so users can easily get back to the products  they were looking at 
Severity Rating: 1/3

### 8 - Aesthetic and minimalist design -- only present useful and relevant information
It is understandable Philips wants to provide information on product design and professional advice on product usage. However, this may lead to information overload. There is too much information on one page with both static and dynamic pictures, which lacks white space to allow content to be more digestible.
Severity Rating: 2/3

### 9 - Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors -- when error occurs, the system should provide suggestions on how to fix it
When users enter invalid information, the system shows suggestions on how to rectify the problem. To offer users with more concise instructions, the system could offer images showing users where to find the product number/name. It could also take a step further by listing out possible product information.
Severity Rating: 1/3

### 10 - Help and documentation -- allow users to search for help easily
It is easy to search for help by using the Contact us shortcut on the bottom right corner, or click on the Support button on the top left of each page. The users can either browse topics by category or enter model number for FAQs and user manuals. Though the system provides a chat box, the chat is offline and not not responsive.
